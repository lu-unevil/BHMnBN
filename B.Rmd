# Abstract
An ecological risk assessment is about integrating sources of evidence with expert knowledge to assess severity of impacts or likelihood of adverse events. An important task in risk assessment is to evaluate the impact of limitations in knowledge on epistemic uncertainty in the assessment. The Bayesian paradigm contains several pillars: Bayes rule for inference, subjective probability to quantify uncertainty and a rule for Bayes optimal decisions. These can, but don’t have to be used together to assess risk. Depending on the nature of the risk assessment, probabilistic reasoning applies on variables (aleatory uncertainty) or on models (or parameters within models) (epistemic uncertainty). Bayesian hierarchical models can consider both aleatory and epistemic uncertainty with statistical and predictive rigor, but at the loss of computational speed as the model become more complex. In this talk, I will clarify the distinction between Bayesian networks and Bayesian hierarchical modelling, and show the usefulness and limitations of both approaches. I conclude my talk by proposing a way forward, where both Bayesian networks and Bayesian hierarchical modelling are used for ecological risk assessment.

# Uncertainty in risk assessment

- Uncertainty arise from limitations in knowledge

- Someone is uncertain

- Epistemic uncertainty: uncertainty about the model (including parameters), lack of scientific consensus, small sample sizes, bias or low quality in experimental studies, observation or measurement errors, ambiguous terms, misunderstandings

- Aleatory uncertainty: inherent randomness in real world systems, heterogeneity, variability, between study variability, chance outcomes

- Ontological uncertainty

# Communicate uncertainty
- Communicating uncertainty to decision makers is important

"Unless uncertainty is known
a decision maker can place too much confidence in experts and face unexpected problems
or a decision maker can place too little confidence in experts and miss opportunities and resources to collect information has been waisted

In some situations it can be motivated to hide one’s uncertainty, but in scientific assessments honesty is the only option"

These can, but don’t have to be used together to assess risk. 

In what way are Bayesian Networks related to these three pillars of Bayesian methods?

What is required to treat uncertainty when BNs are used for ecological risk assessment?

###Proposition
Statistical models which quantify uncertainty in parameters can support uncertainty analysis of BNs  [needs reformulation]

# Bayesian networks
###Epistemic BN
Epistemic BNs are expert-informed networks used for probabilistic reasoning in light of the evidence brought into the network. 

Node state probabilities (other than nodes for data) are subjective probabilities that express epistemic uncertainty

###Aleatory BN
Node state probabilities are relative frequencies that express aleatory uncertainty (variability)

An aleatory BN is a model for aleatory uncertainty in probabilistic risk assessments.

###Predictive BN

A predictive BN is a BN where the probability distribution for the assessment variable nodes represents a mixture of uncertainty and variability about a future sampling event. 

Node state probabilities are a ‘predictive distribution’, which combine aleatory and epistemic uncertainty.
Predictive distributions express both aleatory and epistemic uncertainty, but in an unknown combination. 

Examples, demo using GeNIE

# A way forward
Both Bayesian networks and Bayesian hierarchical modelling should be used for ecological risk assessment. 
BHM for parametric inference

-Aleatory BN to build integrated assessment models to assess probability of adverse events or impacts

-Epistemic BN to support the parametrisation e.g. based on multiple studies (evidence synthesis) to do probabilistic reasoning of the state of a system (toxic, present, invasive etc)

# Borsuk revisited

Use aleatory BN to combine variables from several BHMs

# xx revisited

Use epistemic BN to reason using parameters informed by evidence synthesis set up as a BHMs
