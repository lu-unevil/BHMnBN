# Abstract

12 minutes or less

An ecological risk assessment is about integrating sources of evidence with expert knowledge to assess severity of impacts or likelihood of adverse events. An important task in risk assessment is to evaluate the impact of limitations in knowledge on epistemic uncertainty in the assessment. The Bayesian paradigm contains several pillars: Bayes rule for inference, subjective probability to quantify uncertainty and a rule for Bayes optimal decisions. These can, but don’t have to be used together to assess risk. Depending on the nature of the risk assessment, probabilistic reasoning applies on variables (aleatory uncertainty) or on models (or parameters within models) (epistemic uncertainty). Bayesian hierarchical models can consider both aleatory and epistemic uncertainty with statistical and predictive rigor, but at the loss of computational speed as the model become more complex. In this talk, I will clarify the distinction between Bayesian networks and Bayesian hierarchical modelling, and show the usefulness and limitations of both approaches. I conclude my talk by proposing a way forward, where both Bayesian networks and Bayesian hierarchical modelling are used for ecological risk assessment.

# Uncertainty in risk assessment

- Uncertainty arise from limitations in knowledge

- Uncertainty is personal. *Someone* is uncertain

- Epistemic uncertainty (from Ancient Greek: *ἐπιστήμη*, epistēmē, 'knowledge')

  - uncertainty about the model (including parameters), lack of scientific consensus, small sample sizes, bias or low quality in experimental studies, observation or measurement errors, ambiguous terms, misunderstandings

- Aleatory uncertainty (from Latin *ālĕa*, dice): 
  - inherent randomness in real world systems, heterogeneity, variability, between study variability, chance outcomes

- Ontological uncertainty
  - uncertainty about the future, in which our current objectives, management alternatives and understanding of the world (models) are made obsolete by change.

# Communicate uncertainty
- Communicating uncertainty to decision makers is important

>"Unless uncertainty is known a decision maker can place too much confidence in experts and face unexpected problems
or a decision maker can place too little confidence in experts and miss opportunities and resources to collect information has been waisted. <br>
>In some situations it can be motivated to hide one’s uncertainty, but in scientific assessments honesty is the only option"

### Questions
In what way are Bayesian Networks related to these three pillars of Bayesian methods?  

What is required to treat uncertainty when BNs are used for ecological risk assessment?

**These three Bayesian pillars can, but don’t have to be used together in an assessment.** 

**Uncertainty about the model structure and parameters within models is not handled by BNs by default.**

**How to treat uncertainty depends on the type of network**

###Epistemic BN
Epistemic BNs are expert-informed networks used for probabilistic reasoning in light of the evidence brought into the network. 

Node state probabilities (other than nodes for data) are subjective probabilities that express epistemic uncertainty.
###Aleatory BN
An aleatory BN is a model for aleatory uncertainty in a probabilistic risk assessment.

Node state probabilities are relative frequencies that express aleatory uncertainty (variability).

**Statistical models which explicitly address uncertainty can support parametric inference and uncertainty analysis in ERA.**

# BHM for uncertainty analysis of a BN
.pull-left[
A BN can be "wrapped" into a hierarchical model and Bayesian inference can be used to quantify uncertainty by probability.

Hierarchical Models (HM) attribute variation to different sources expressed as conditional probability distributions

Bayesian HM express uncertainty in parameters by probability distributions and can integrate expert judgment and data for inference
